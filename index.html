                            <p>The term ‘ecosystem genomics’ has been used in the past by both geneticists and ecosystem biologists as an aspiration for disciplinary integration; yet, the aim of placing genomes into a framework capable of predicting the rates and outcomes of ecosystem processes has remained elusive. The Ecosystem Genomics Initiative will provide a basis to investigate principles for integrating data and theory to synthesize a unified, genes-to-ecosystems framework for predicting ecosystem processes and managing them to sustainable ends. The discipline of genome biology is poised to drive broad, integrative research projects in ecosystem ecology. For example, the Earth Microbiome Project aims to ‘analyze microbial communities across the globe and within the environmental parameter space of different biomes’. The NIH launched the Human Microbiome Project to understand how the ‘ecosystem’ of the human body controls the expression of complex diseases. The Biology Directorate at NSF established a community Wiki to relieve bottlenecks that impede progress on the genome-to-phenome grand challenge. At the same time, ecosystem scientists have shown that some of the complex feedbacks in Earth Systems Models (ESMs) are more accurately represented when genome and trait data are included. Ecosystem biologists have asked: ‘how can we use genomic details about organisms and communities to accurately predict the roles of specific traits in controlling ecosystem processes and their relation to challenges such as climate change’?</p>
                            <p>The central factors that are missing, but required, to translate genomics into ecosystem processes are foundational theory, case studies and models. The absence of these elements prevents us from addressing questions such as: Why are some genes more important than others in determining the aggregate traits of ecosystems? To what degree do plant genomes control the community assembly of soil microbial genomes, and produce a microbiome that determines ecosystem aggregate traits? What are the scaling ‘conveniences’ that will enable us to represent the translation from genes to traits to processes in models of the entire earth system? To link genomics to processes, and thus create the predictive framework we seek, foundational theory must be developed to define the complete genes-to-ecosystems translation. Case studies should be used to align measurements of genes, traits and processes in complementary environments and systems. Through this alignment, we can be sure we have all the elements of the theory represented in specific ecosystems. With theory and case studies in hand, we can iteratively develop, test, and refine hierarchically-organized models. The discipline of ecosystem genomics that we envision will advance a broad framework for predictive ecosystem genomics. Our research will build this framework through an integrated portfolio of complementary questions, scales, and ecosystems. Through research and education activities we will create international impact by designing new types of models that inform global climate policy, identifying genes and genomic interactions that enhance crop yield, and training a new generation of students to join the national workforce in fields such as ecosystem management, medical genetics and food security

                                        David Moore is an ecologist who studies how ecosystems and climate influence each other. Moore trys to understand how carbon, water, energy and nutrients move through ecosystems. He treats mathematical models of ecosystems as formal hypotheses about how ecological processes control ecosystem functions. Moore investigates these processes at different scales and currently his research group is working on how the seasonality of fluxes of carbon and water influence the controls of net primary productivity and carbon allocation in ecosystems, how species or plant functional types cause changes in land surface processes and how microbial activity influences biogeochemical cycling. To do this they use a variety of lines of evidence from leaf level ecophysiology to satellite remote sensing and try to combine these data with mathematical models using formal statistical approaches.

                                        I am an integrative microbial ecologist with training in microbial ecology, evolutionary biology, mycology, and genomics. My primary research interest is on plant-microbial interactions, specifically on asymptomatic endophytic fungi. Endophytes occur within all plant species, where they can provide defense against herbivores and pathogens, as well as tolerance to heat and drought. Using field sampling, traditional culture-based methods, and next-generation sequencing of genomes and communities I am interested in characterizing the biotic and abiotic factors shaping the assembly of plant-associated fungal communities, how community structure and diversity impacts ecosystem function, and the evolutionary dynamics of fungal symbiont evolution in the context of closely related pathogens and saprotrophs.

We focus on resolving the genomic underpinnings of microbe-mediated biogeochemical transformations in soils that drive significant atmospheric fluxes. The goal of my work is to determine when and how projections of biogeochemical transformations are improved by better representation of underlying biological drivers.

                                        Our lab investigates how the ecology of a species shapes patterns of variation at multiple levels (genes, pathways, transcriptomes, genomes, physiology, behavior and life history), how populations adapt to environmental shifts, the implication of ecological adaptation in the process of speciation and the role of sexual selection and sexual conflict in the evolution of reproductive incompatibilites. Our research revolves around these fundamental aspects of evolutionary biology. We mostly focus on a group of cactophilic Drosophila that inhabit the deserts of North America. These Drosophila species are an excellent system to study given that their ecology is well understood and the fact that we can perform many genetic, genomic, manipulative and life history experiments.

                                        The Carini lab is broadly focused on understanding how microbes help make Earth habitable for humans. This view leads us to diverse questions in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with the goal of understanding how microbial communities transform important nutrients, remove pollutants, affect soil fertility and influence aquatic productivity. By studying the growth of microbial cultures, their genome sequences and their environmental distributions, we design experiments that help uncover new and unusual biogeochemical cycles and provide hypothesis-based explanations for long standing geochemical observations. Integrated ecosystem genomics-based approaches such as these are invaluable to help us understand the roles of microbes on Earth. We are also interested in how exposure to cosmopolitan environmental microbes that live in soil, water and dust influences human health. Using a combination of high-throughput cultivation and laboratory study, we seek a mechanistic understanding of the factors that influence the distributions of these microbes in their natural environment and the specific ways that exposure benefits (or is detrimental) to human health.

Microbes define soil health, support ecosystem services, and maintain plant diversity. They are critical to ecosystem resiliency, especially in the context of climate change and the conservation challenges we currently face. Working across a range of ecosystems from lowland tropical forests, to high elevation conifer forests, to semi-arid grasslands, we use field-based experiments, microbiological techniques, and contemporary genetic tools to test the effects of plant-microbe interactions on plant and microbe community diversity, understand how environmental shifts will alter these interactions, and accurately predict the subsequent impacts on ecosystem function.

                                        My lab studies the microbial ecology and recovery of disturbed and marginal terrestrial ecosystems that are characterized by oligotrophy or nutrient poor conditions. We seek to understand patterns in microbial diversity that correlate with the sustainability of vegetation in disturbed regions such as mining wastes and arid desert ecosystems. Both culture- and molecular/phylogenetic-based approaches are used including metagenomic analysis of ecosystem communities. A second focal area is the study of “eco-friendly” microbial surfactants (biosurfactants) including discovery of new biosurfactants, elucidating the microbial physiology associated with biosurfactant production as well as the role of biosurfactants in microbial survival. This work is being translated into potential biomedical and environmental applications, e.g., harvesting rare earth elements from industrial waste streams.

In the past, I have studied plant-microorganism interactions in the alpine ecosystem nitrogen cycle and I have studied the evolution of C4 photosynthesis in plants.

                                                My research focuses on what might be called “biogeochemical ecology,” asking questions about how climate interacts with plant physiology, demography, and ecological processes to influence or control biogeochemical cycling from local to global scales. Just one example of the need for more complete understanding in this area is the lack of species interactions in modern global climate models, even though such interactions can be critically important in controlling ecosystem carbon cycling and hence, feedbacks to climate. Progress has been limited by the difficulty of bridging the gap between local-scale ecological interactions and broader biogeochemical processes. I use multidisciplinary approaches that combine classical techniques of field ecology and forestry with advanced technological methods (e.g., the micrometeorological eddy covariance method, isotopic techniques) and modeling to integrate biogeochemical processes to ecosystem scales.

                                            As the world faces global change and resource limitation, understanding the planet’s microbes (e.g. bacteria, archaea) becomes a necessity. This is because microbes drive the biogeochemistry that runs the planet, and are central to human endeavors, from food to health to industry. Viruses that infect microbes profoundly shape microbial populations and processes by acting as both major predators and sources of new genes.
                                            
                                            We work to understand viral impacts on globally important microbial processes. As empiricists, we test hypotheses through direct systems-level studies of natural populations, complemented by developing and studying model phage-host systems in the lab with the goal of generating the data required for predictive ecosystem modeling. Practically, we develop new ways to “see” viruses — in the microscope, in environmental sequence datasets, in experiments — i.e., we are learning how to “count” across different data types.
